## ‚òÅOverview
This project was created to give users the ability to share music with each other.

The technologies involved are:

1) HTML/CSS (JSX)(Front-End)
2) React.js (Front-end)
3) Firebase (Back-end)
4) Firestore (Database)
5) Google Cloud Functions (To control parts of back-end)
6) Algolia (Search functionality) 

The reason I choose these technologies is because **React** is apart of my main stack, and it's something I use often. **HTML/CSS** are a must when working with **React**, due to the nature of JSX. At the beginning of this project I hadn't expanded my development skills into **full-stack**, which is why I chose to work with the most viable solution for the back-end, which happened to be **Firebase**. **Firebase** comes with a lot of built in tools such as **Firestore** + **Google Cloud Functions**, which is what I needed to create a functioning database and **CRUD** system.
